                üíï One of the greatest challenges of being an OFW is maintaining close relationships with family members thousands of miles away. Distance can strain even the strongest bonds, but with intention and effort, you can keep your family connections strong and meaningful.

              <p>
                üì± <strong>Create consistent communication schedules.</strong> Regular contact is more valuable than lengthy but infrequent conversations. Find times that work for both you and your family, considering time zone differences.

              <p>
                üíî <strong>It is normal to feel sad sometimes.</strong> Missing important moments and feeling disconnected from daily family life is part of the OFW experience. Acknowledge these feelings and find healthy ways to cope.
